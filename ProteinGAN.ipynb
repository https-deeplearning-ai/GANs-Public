        "Proteins are large, complex molecules that play many critical roles in living organisms, including humans. You can think of them as very tiny, programmable robots used by nature to perform various functions, e.g. building, modifying or breaking down other molecules, aiding in cell replication and division, and transporting other proteins inside of cells. Apart from the crucial cellular functions, proteins are used virtually everywhere in our daily life, starting from animal nutrition and washing powders down to costly drugs and therapeutic antibodies. Using synthetic biology, protein engineering, adaptive evolutions experimental techniques, researchers enhance proteins' properties, making them more active or \"sticky\" towards a particular drug target or resistant to harsh environemental conditions. However, it is challenging to randomly modify proteins in a \"biochemically meaningful\" way such that protein would remain functional leading in a very costly time-consuming experiments. Thus generating natural-like diverse proteins that remain functional is of outstanding importance for biotechnology and biomedical applications. \n"

        "### ProteinGAN\n",
        " \n",
        "ProteinGAN is a generative adversarial network adapted to generate functional protein sequences. At its core, it consists of common building blocks: a discriminator and generator, spectral normalization (as in the [SN-GAN optional notebook](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-basic-generative-adversarial-networks-gans/ungradedLab/c2FPs/optional-sn-gan)), and a loss function based on earth mover's distance (as in the [WGAN-GP assignment](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-basic-generative-adversarial-networks-gans/programming/mTm3U/wgan)), etc. \n",
        "\n",
        "To make the GAN concept work in the field of synthetic biology, the generator and discriminator architectures have been modified to handle sequences of categorical values, capture long-distance relationships, as well as discriminate between various areas in the sequences. This is a major difference from pixel values in images and helps specifically with this type of long, categorical, and sequential data. One question to mull over: could this data processing and understanding help with generating text? \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Data pre-processing.** The explored protein space is very unevenly distributed. Some proteins and their close variants are widely studied while others are just recorded in public databases. Without the balancing, the neural network mainly focuses on big clusters of similar well-studied sequences while treating unrepresented cluster members as anomalies. ProteinGAN has in-built upsampling capability to balance the dataset based on the size of the cluster in order to preserve the diversity of sequences.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Discrete values.** One of the biggest differences between images and proteins is the data type: while images consist of continuous values, proteins are built from discrete building blocks. To address this challenge for backpropagation, ProteinGAN employs the [Gumbel-Softmax trick with temperature](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01144), which serves as a differentiable approximation to sampling discrete data. This allows to end-to-end training of the discriminator and generator while operating in discrete input space. \n",
        "\n",
        "**Convergence.** GANs are known to be difficult to train due to stability issues. The discrete nature of the input further aggravates this problem. Despite the implementation of spectral normalization and WGAN loss, the optimization of ProteinGAN did not lead to convergence. However, as demonstrated in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04406), training with zero-centered gradient penalties leads to improved training and guarantees local convergence even if data and generator distributions are not continuous. Adapting the implementation of [non-saturating loss with R1 regularization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04406) greatly improves the performance of the GAN as demonstrated in the figure below.\n",
